## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### Critical Security Safeguards
1. **Domain Verification (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)**
   ```python
   def verify_domain_match(email, company_record):
       email_domain = email.split('@')[1]
       return email_domain == company_record['email_domain']
   ```
   - ✅ Prevents Company A receiving Company B's pricing
   - ✅ CRITICAL level errors block sends immediately
   - ✅ No override capability (by design)

2. **File Existence Validation**
   - ✅ Verifies pricing files exist before send attempts
   - ✅ Prevents embarrassing empty attachments
   - ✅ Path and filename validation

3. **Recipient Authorization**
   - ✅ Only pre-approved email addresses receive pricing
   - ✅ Prevents accidental sends to competitors
   - ✅ Database-controlled recipient lists

4. **Audit Trail**
   - ✅ Every verification attempt logged
   - ✅ Security violations tracked
   - ✅ Complete compliance capability

### Fail-Safe Design
- **Philosophy:** Better to not send than send wrong data
- **Implementation:** System fails closed on any verification doubt
- **Error Handling:** Clear, actionable error messages
- **User Experience:** Warnings require explicit confirmation
