# Customer Database Migration & Enhanced Verification System v2.0

## 🚨 CRITICAL BUSINESS SYSTEM

This system implements a comprehensive customer database migration with multi-layer verification to **prevent sending wrong pricing data to customers**. The system operates on a **ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY** - it is better to not send than to send wrong data.

## 🔐 Security Features

### Multi-Layer Verification System
1. **Level 1 - Pre-send checks:**
   - ✅ Email domain matches customer record
   - ✅ Pricing file exists at specified path
   - ✅ Filename matches expected pattern
   - ✅ Recipient email exists in database

2. **Level 2 - Content validation:**
   - ✅ Price file company name matches customer record
   - ✅ Email recipient name matches database
   - ✅ No mismatched domains (prevents Company A getting Company B prices)
   - ✅ File size reasonable (not empty, not corrupted)

3. **Level 3 - Final confirmation:**
   - ✅ Display preview with verification status
   - ✅ Require user confirmation for any warnings
   - ✅ Complete audit trail logging

### Domain Verification (CRITICAL)
```python
def verify_domain_match(email, company_record):
    """
    CRITICAL: Verify email domain matches customer record
    Prevents wrong prices to wrong customer
    """
    email_domain = email.split('@')[1]
    return email_domain == company_record['email_domain']
```

## 🔍 Verification Examples

### ✅ PASS Example
```
Customer: Atlantic Performance Oils

```
Customer: Unknown
Recipient: John <john@wrongdomain.com>
Attachment: pricing_file.pdf
Domain check: ❌ No customer record found
File check: ❌ Cannot verify
Status: FAIL - DO NOT SEND
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Comprehensive Tests
```bash
# Run all verification tests
python tests/test_verification_system_v2.py

# Tests include:
# - Domain verification (CRITICAL)
# - File existence checks
# - Security violation detection
# - End-to-end workflows
```

### Critical Test Scenarios
1. **Domain Mismatch Prevention**
   - ❌ `user@companya.com` getting `companyb_pricing.pdf`
   - ✅ System blocks with CRITICAL error

2. **Missing File Prevention**
   - ❌ Pricing file doesn't exist
   - ✅ System blocks with ERROR

3. **Unauthorized Email Prevention**
   - ❌ Email not in customer's authorized list
   - ✅ System blocks with WARNING

## 📋 Customer Database Schema

## 🔒 Security Guarantees

### What This System Prevents
1. **Cross-Customer Data Exposure**
   - Company A never receives Company B's pricing
   - Domain verification ensures correct targeting

2. **Unauthorized Recipients**
   - Only pre-approved email addresses receive pricing
   - Prevents accidental sends to competitors

3. **Missing File Errors**
   - System verifies files exist before attempting send
   - Prevents embarrassing empty or missing attachments

4. **Complete Audit Trail**
   - Every action logged with timestamp and user
   - Full compliance and troubleshooting capability

### Error Handling Philosophy
- **Fail Safe:** System fails closed, preventing sends on any doubt
- **Clear Errors:** Detailed error messages explain exactly what's wrong
- **No Silent Failures:** All issues logged and reported
- **User Confirmation:** Warnings require explicit user approval

## 🚨 Important Notes

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
1. **Excel File Must Be Closed** before running migration
2. **Outlook Must Be Running** and configured for email generation
3. **File Paths Must Exist** as specified in database
4. **Domain Verification Cannot Be Disabled** - this is a security requirement

### Before Each Use
1. ✅ Verify customer database is current
2. ✅ Check that pricing files exist at specified paths
3. ✅ Review any verification warnings in logs
4. ✅ Test with one customer before bulk generation

### Emergency Procedures
If verification system reports errors:
1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with email generation
2. **Review** the specific error messages
3. **Fix** the underlying issue (wrong domain, missing file, etc.)
4. **Re-test** verification before proceeding
5. **Never override** CRITICAL errors

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Customer record not found"**
- Check email domain spelling in database
- Verify customer is marked as active
- Confirm email domain matches exactly

**"File not found"**
- Verify file path exists in Windows Explorer
- Check filename matches exactly (case sensitive)
- Ensure file is not locked by another application

**"Domain verification failed"**
- **DO NOT IGNORE** - This prevents wrong data exposure
- Check customer's email domain in database
- Verify email address is correctly formatted

### Log Files
- `logs/migration_v2.log` - Migration process logs
- `logs/verification_v2.log` - Verification attempt logs
